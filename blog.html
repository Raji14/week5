      <h2 class="blog-post-title">FIRST CHRISTMAS IN SPAIN!</h2>
      <p class="blog-post-meta">December 1, 2017 by <a href="#">Rajitha</a></p>

      <p>Hey friends! We’re back today with the second video in our series about Christmas in Barcelona, and today’s subject is near and dear to my exterior-illumination-loving heart… …Christmas lights!</p>
      <p>For weeks and weeks, we watched during the daytime as thousands of lights were strung across all of the streets here in Barcelona in preparation for the holidays. Then finally, on Thanksgiving night at 6pm, the entire city suddenly flickered on. And it has felt absolutely magical here each night ever since. ✨✨✨ Truly. From the grandest of ramblas, to the tiniest hidden back alleys, literally every street here in the city center is aglow with some sort of twinkly lights strung above. And the best part is that every single street is also different! From Gatsby-style white string lights, to all sorts of creative shapes and phrases, to lights that flicker to music, to art installations with cool people and stories behind them, to nativities and Christmas trees and decorated street lights galore, the sheer scope and creativity of the Christmas lights game here in Barcelona is unbelievable. And I can’t get enough of it all.</p>
      <p>Also, if you haven’t already, be sure to subscribe to our YouTube channel to follow along with this series. And definitely stay tuned next week, because we have a new video coming your way, devoted entirely to the “pooper” of presents for all of the children in Catalonia — the illustrious Christmas log — Caga Tió.</p>

      <h2 class="blog-post-title">DIY LEATHER BRACELET</h2>
      <p class="blog-post-meta">November 25, 2017 by <a href="#">Rajitha</a></p>
      <img src="images/IMG_9805-576x359.jpg" alt="Leather Bracelet">
      <p>Happy Saturday friends! This past week I was feeling the itch to expand my jewelry collection. Anyone that knows me would say that I am a pretty simple gal when it comes to the jewelry department. In fact, most days I don’t wear any at all. But last week…I was feeling it.</p>
      <p>My go-to piece of jewelry is usually a simple necklace, but for this specific moment I was really wanting a bracelet. I don’t know if anyone else has this issue, but for me, bracelets are hard too find. They tend to be way too big for my wrists and can sometimes be uncomfortable. But I have recently been experimenting with leather remnants and decided this was the perfect opportunity to make a bracelet of my own.</p>

      <p class="blog-post-meta">November 11, 2017 by <a href="#">Rajitha</a></p>
      <img src="images/IMG_8386-576x359.jpg" alt="Herb Planter">
      <p>Happy Weekend! This week has been filled with all things summer. Grilling out, iced coffee, and trips to the farmer’s market were all highlights for me.</p>
      <p>Every time I go to the farmer’s market I get the urge to buy one of their beautiful bouquets of fresh flowers. They are always so cheery and full of life. I have learned though, that my poor husband just can’t handle those beauties in our home. Let’s just say his allergies are a little out of control. So, because I can’t have flowers inside my home, I have started decorating the outside with flowers, and I love it! Recently, I made a simple flower box to hang outside on my porch. But you’ll never guess the main supply…</p>
